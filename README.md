## Introduction
This repository contains code for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using the VGG19 deep learning model. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset available on Kaggle. It contains images categorized into two classes: NORMAL and PNEUMONIA.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pneumonia_detection.git
cd pneumonia_detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage


Ensure you have the dataset downloaded and properly structured.
Update the dataset directory paths in the script accordingly.
Run the script to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

## Model Training


The model uses the VGG19 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet. The final layers are fine-tuned for binary classification (NORMAL vs. PNEUMONIA).

## Evaluation


The model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics. Early stopping and model checkpointing are used to optimize training.

## Results


Visualizations include sample images with predicted labels, confusion matrix, and training history plots.
